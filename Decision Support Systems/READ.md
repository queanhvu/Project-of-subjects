For businesses to succeed in the era of e-commerce, it is critical to comprehend client psychology. This study explores the use of sentiment analysis to assess customer happiness, with a particular focus on Shopee food, a well-known food delivery service in Southeast Asia. By carefully examining user reviews and comments on the platform, the initiative aims to develop a model that can reliably predict whether a sentiment is good, negative, or neutral. The project's outcomes are meant to offer insightful information on how satisfied customers are with Shopee Food. Shopee Food may enhance the quality of its services, modify food and delivery standards, and improve the overall customer experience by effectively recognizing the critical aspects that impact customer emotions.
